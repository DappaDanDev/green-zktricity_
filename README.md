# Green Zktricity 

Zero Knowledge is sooooo hot right now! Do you know what else is so hot right now? THE EARTH! 

Green Zkrciticty brings the power of Zero Knowledge to contribute in combating Climate Change. This is done by providing a scalable and privacy
preserving way to label electricity as coming from either green sources such as wind/solar or grey sources like burning coal.

## Why is this important? (Or was it just something fun to do in between playing with cats)

Labeling electricity is important to increase the use of green energy usage. Being able to tell the difference between green and grey sources helps with consumer trust and any government programs to increase green energy usage. Given what is at stake, this has created a system that is open to fraud at worst and number trickery at best. 


The data shows green resources are still dwarfed by grey resources. Just look at Turkey's numbers:

## Why Blockchain? (If this wasn't ETH Global, Would you still build this the same way?)
Outside of the weekly crypto conference, blockchains are appreciated by enterprises because they are a neutral platform to conduct business and operations. Where they fall is in both scalability and privacy due to their openness which for this use case both are needed. 


## Why ZK? (Are you just looking for investors?)
ZK adds both a layer to be more efficient and private. Privacy is important here because a consumer's electricity consumption can be linked to other habits like a daily schedule, traveling, and household numbers. It is important that the calculation to confirm that the calculation to confirm that the amount of both green and grey energy generated and consumed is equal and is also kept private. This prevents the ability for any false reporting by generators. 



## What Has Been Built 

## What is Left to Build 
Using an Account Abstraction service, creating accounts for each of the meters to easily send messages to the smart contract. I mean, can you imagine someone in a coal mine or wind farm having to set up Metamask???
